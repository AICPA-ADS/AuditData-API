        Each record represents the balance expected from the customer for one uniquely identifiable transaction. This file should be at the summary level (by invoice), not at the detailed level (by invoice line item). The sum total of the transaction amounts as of the specified date should reconcile to the total AR amount in the general ledger (GL) as of the same date.

        Should be able to pass a date and get back a list of all the invoices amounts that were outstanding at that date.
